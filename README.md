# [Moiva.io](https://moiva.io/) Catalog

## Purpose
This repository is used by Moiva.io 
- to suggest software alternatives to users
![image showing how Moiva's suggestions look like](./suggestions.png)
- to generate the Moiva's sitemap with possible comparisons (to help developers find the tool they deseprately need)
![image showing an except of Moiva's sitemap](./sitemap.png)
- to show libraries suggestions in a user friendly way (using aliases)
- to know if a repository has a related npm package as its core artifact so that Moiva can show relevant charts, for example, Npm Downloads or Npm releases (in case a user searches for a Github repository, not for an Npm package).

## Structure
The catalog is a collection of Libraries (you can learn more about the Library concept in the [the Moiva's readme](https://github.com/aantipov/moiva)).

Libraries are grouped into categories - one file per category.
